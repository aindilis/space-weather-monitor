Description: Space Weather Alert System
 The Space Weather Alert System is a Perl script that fetches space weather data
 from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and sends notifications
 to users when the threat level exceeds a certain threshold. The script is designed
 to run as a systemd service on Debian 12 and can send notifications via desktop
 notifications and email.
 .
 Features:
 - Fetches space weather data from NOAA's 27-day outlook, 3-day forecast, and 3-day
   geomagnetic forecast
 - Parses the fetched data to extract relevant information
 - Determines the overall threat level based on the parsed data
 - Sends desktop notifications to logged-in users using `notify-send`
 - Sends email notifications to users as a fallback
 - Runs as a systemd service on a daily basis
 .
 This package depends on Perl 5 and the following Perl modules:
 - WWW::Mechanize
 - Email::Sender::Simple
 - Email::Simple
 - Email::Simple::Creator
 .
 It also requires the `notify-send` command for desktop notifications and systemd
 for running the script as a service.
